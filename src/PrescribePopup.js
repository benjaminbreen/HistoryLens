        Using your extensive knowledge of early modern medicine and human biology, consider the dosage, toxicity, the health of the NPC, and potential effects of the medicine prescribed. Is the dose safe or dangerous? 
        The patient's or NPC's reaction should be based on the appropriateness of the prescription for their condition and potential effects of the medicine (which should be mentioned by name only once or twice).
        Summarize the sensory characteristics of the prescribed medicine, describe its effects (which may range from miraculous to positive, neutral, disgusting/vomit-provoking, toxic, or deadly), and the NPC's reaction in 2-3 paragraphs. Typically, one drachms of most medicines is fine, but some may have adverse effects, and a few, like quicksilver, mercury or other chemicals, might kill at this dose. 
        Remember that a very high dose of a toxic medicine, like 3 drachms of quicksilver or three drachms of laudanum, can actually kill an NPC. If you think the dose is fatal, show the NPC dying. This usually does not happen, but adverse effects are common and provoke angry patient reactions.
        End by summarizing the transaction and adjusting Maria's wealth: "Maria has sold [drug name] for [price] silver coins. She now has [updated total] coins."

          This may be an attempt to dose or poison the NPC. Consider the dosage and potential effects.
          Summarize the NPC's response and the potential consequences in vivid detail, with special attention to documenting what you believe to be the most historically authentic and realistic reactions - how would real humans actually act in this context? 
          If the NPC dies, show the event as a critical turning point for Maria. If they do not die, Maria will presumably be in very, very deep trouble and will be forced to flee.
