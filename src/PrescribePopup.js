If the treatment is successful, the Inquisitor thanks Maria effusively and sends her on her way. If it failed, he arrests her for brujeria and jails her. Ensure historical accuracy regarding the type and effects of the treatment.
      Remember that this treatment is taking place in the personal residence of Valdez, not Maria's shop, and under extremely tense circumstances as the revelation of his syphilis would be catastrophic for him. There is notable tension and Maria wonders when the other shoe will drop - is her life at risk?

    The transaction occurred at ${time} on ${date}, in ${location}. (This is context and should not be restated to the player.)
    Maria's current wealth is ${currentWealth} silver coins.

    Using your knowledge of early modern medicine and human biology, assess the safety and effectiveness of this prescription. Focus on the dosage, toxicity, and health condition of the NPC. Some prescriptions can cause an NPC to die or suffer disabling complications. 
    Be unsparing, detailed, and blunt in your descriptions of effects. If a drug causes diarrhea, go into detail! If it causes vomiting, likewise. Or if it does nothing, show disappointment (a patient might say something like "I should go to a real physician and be bled - that will fix it" or "I should have stayed in bed" or "That was... well, it didn't kill me, at least."). Or if it's a miracle cure, show an exuberant reaction of joy. 
    This is an educational game about history of medicine so pull no punches if a prescription is truly toxic. However, also be realistic: oral delivery of chamomile, or topical application of sugar, will never cause real complications, it simply won't work. Others like saffron or wine might be pleasant but mostly ineffective. 
    Same with relatively benign but odd things like crab's eyes. It's really in the realm of things like mercury (and other minerals) or opiates (and other narcotics or poisonous plants) that it becomes dangerous. Think carefully and draw on your knowledge before assessing the outcome. Some pontial reactions would be things along the lines of:
    "The cinchona powder burns as I drink it, but my headache fades soon after." "The poultice smells like earth, and the infection seems to be drawn out by it."  "The draught tastes foul, but I feel a bit better." ""The wine mixed with ground unicorn horn is bitter and expensive. I feel no result." "The bittersweet treacle sticks to my throat, and I fear it is worsening my humoral imbalance." "The smoke from this dried tobacco leaf is rather unpleasant, but I can breathe easier."

    Always begin your output with a clear and concise **headline** that summarizes your assessment of the prescription. For significant results, add a SINGLE emoji to symbolize the main message at the end. Use appropriate markdown formatting as follows:

    - **h3 markdown**: Use h3 markdown tags (###) for headlines where the effects are neutral, positive, or only slightly negative. For example, you might write: 
      ### Maria attempted an unconventional treatment that was somewhat effective ‚öñ
      or
      ### The prescription was revolting and led to minor complications ü§¢
      or 
         ### The prescription was unpleasant but highly effective
      or ### The patient balked at the high price and walked out without paying üí∏
      or ### The patient had a miraculous recovery! üçÄ
      or ### The patient felt neutral effects ‚öñÔ∏è
      or ### The patient feels better - the treatment worked well.
      Or many others of your choice. 

    - **h5 markdown**: Use h5 markdown tags (#####) for headlines where the patient has suffered **serious harm** or a **fatal reaction**. When using h5:
      - If the patient **died**, always start with: ##### üíÄ The patient has died! üíÄ
      - For more minor injuries, use something like:
        ##### The prescription seems to have failed... 
      - Remember that if a patient is likely to die in a turn, go with "The patient has died" as the headline. Be realistic and don't hold back.

    **Important:**
    - The headline must always appear as the first line of the output.
    - Ensure the markdown tags (### or #####) are correctly used at the start of the headline.
    - Do not restate the markdown tags or explain the headline in your output‚Äîjust present the headline with the appropriate markdown tag.

    ### Patient Reactions:
    After the headline, describe the patient's experience over a period of three hours in 3 highly detailed paragraphs which emphasize vivid, historically authentic characterization and finely observed details:
    - Focus on the **sensory characteristics** of the medicine (e.g., taste, smell, texture). Always mention the route of administration and give specifics about how it was applied.
    - Show how the patient reacts to the prescribed dose, including the price. This might range from a miraculous cure to mild discomfort to violent reactions like vomiting or even death.
    - Describe the **perceived effects** of the medicine on the patient's health.
    - If the dose is toxic or fatal, be explicit about the timeline of how the patient worsens or dies.
    - If the price is particularly high (over 10 coins, say - though some patients may be able to afford more than this, it depends on the specific NPC) they may walk out without paying or taking the prescription at all. If so, describe this and remember that Maria does not receive any new coins in such a situation.

    ### Dosage & Effects:
    - One drachm of most medicines is usually safe, but two or more drachms of highly toxic substances (like quicksilver or laudanum) could lead to fatal outcomes. If the dose is fatal, show the NPC dying.
    - Angry reactions are common if the medicine is ineffective or causes discomfort, so show the patient's response accordingly.
    - Consider the patient's presumed weight and health AND the route of administration in assessing whether a dose is fatal or highly toxic. For instance, even a single drachm of inhaled quicksilver (mercury) is instantly fatal, as is quicksilver as an enema. However, topical quicksilver is fine. Many drugs are more potent in enema or inhaled form; even one drachm of inhaled opium might be fatal in a weak or small patient, or two drachms of oral. However, in any other situation patients are extremely enthusiastic about opium or opiates, declare themselves cured, and ask for more. Likewise with alcoholic spirits, which are almost always well received by patients but may not actually be a cure. Likewise with many alchemical compounds. 
    - Topical prescriptions are almost always successful (if applied to wounds or related ailments) and are never rejected or disliked by patients. 
    - If a patient dies, Maria has to figure out what to do with the body, sending her storyline into a much darker direction. 
    - Usually a cure will be ineffective or mildly effective. Benign things like wine, rose water, treacles, other sugared medicines, and aguas/distilled waters, plus camphor or herbs, are typically mildly effective. 

    Following the description, in italic markdown tags *like this*, give a short pithy historically authentic quote or proverb from the 17th century which relates to the prescription, if its a non-English original give the original language then translation in brackets. For instance: "The soul and body are like a house divided against itself." ‚Äî Thomas Browne, "Religio Medici" (1643); "Mentre c'√® vita, c'√® speranza" -Italian proverb [Where there is life, there is hope]; "Omnia venena sunt, nec sine veneno quicquam existit" - Quintilian; "Hambre y fr√≠o curan cada desvar√≠o."
Translation: Hunger and cold cure every madness.
Translation: All things are poison, and nothing is without poison.
Translation: While there is life, there is hope.
    Then rate the player's prescription with a score out of 10 (10=best possible prescription choice, 1=worst possible). At the end of the response, provide a summary of Maria's wealth, status, reputation, and the time (remember that at least three hours and possibly more have passed) in **this exact format** using markdown *italic* tags:

    **Now Maria has ${currentWealth + price} silver coins. She is feeling [single word status]. Her reputation is [emoji]. The time is # AM (or PM), xx [month] [year].**

    **Reputation Emoji Guide:**
    - üò° (1) : Extremely bad (e.g., patient dies)
    - üò† (2) : Very bad (e.g., severe complications)
    - üòê (3) : Neutral (e.g., treatment is ineffective but not harmful)
    - üôÇ (5) : Positive (e.g., minor positive effects)
    - üòá (9) : Excellent (e.g., miraculous cure)
    - üëë (10) : Outstanding (e.g., near-mythical healing)
