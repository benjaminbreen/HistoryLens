Ensure historical accuracy regarding the type and effects of the treatment.
      Remember that this treatment is taking place in the personal residence of Valdez, not Maria's shop, and under extremely tense circumstances as the revelation of his syphilis would be catastrophic for him.

    Maria's current wealth is ${currentWealth} silver coins.

    Using your knowledge of early modern medicine, humoral theory, and human biology (and incorporating information from the NPC's secret, social context, and diagnosis), assess the safety and effectiveness of this prescription. Consider both immediate and long-term effects of the medicine. Focus on the dosage, toxicity, and health condition of the NPC, ensuring the response is naturalistic and varied based on the substance and method of delivery. Some prescriptions can cause an NPC to die or suffer disabling complications, but not every instance should result in severe side effects such as nausea unless appropriate.

    Be unsparing, detailed, and realistic in your descriptions. Avoid excessive nausea or vomiting for relatively benign substances like wine, chamomile, or lightly infused herbal remedies unless administered in excess or combined with other dangerous factors. Instead, consider other common reactions in early modern medicine, such as mild discomfort, temporary relief, or no reaction at all. If a treatment is historically known for purging, do not shy away from those reactions, but balance it with other possibilities based on the patient's condition. 

    Consider reactions like:
    - If a drug causes purging (such as vomiting or diarrhea), describe it in vivid, unsparing and graphically realistic sensory detail, but ensure that only substances known for their toxicity or purgative qualities cause such effects.
    - If a prescription causes discomfort or irritation (e.g., an unpleasant taste, slight dizziness), show those effects while emphasizing sensory characteristics like taste, smell, and texture.
    - If the treatment is ineffective, focus on disappointment or resignation in the patient's response. Comments like "I should go to a real physician and be bled" or "I expected more from this treatment" could reflect their frustration. Directly utilize their ${socialContext} and ${secret} to craft their personalized reaction.

    Always be realistic: 
    - Substances like chamomile, sugar, rose water, or wine will not cause serious complications in normal doses. These should produce milder reactions (or no reaction) unless combined with other dangerous factors or taken in excessive amounts.
    - Medications like saffron or wine might give a mildly pleasant or ineffective result, rather than cause harm. More dangerous substances like mercury, opium, and other potent compounds, especially in higher doses or certain delivery methods (like inhalation or enema), should be treated with the appropriate severity. Patients often proclaim opium or opioids and alcoholic cures to be far more effective than they actually are. Inhaled mercury (quicksilver) or mercury products ALWAYS kills a patient in ALL circumstances. 

    Begin your output with a clear and concise **headline** that summarizes your assessment of the prescription. For significant results, add a SINGLE emoji to symbolize the main message at the end. Use appropriate markdown formatting as follows:

    - **h3 markdown**: Use h3 markdown tags (###) for headlines where the effects are neutral, positive, or only slightly negative. For example, you might write: 
      ### Maria attempted an unconventional treatment that was somewhat effective ⚖
      or
      ### The prescription was unpleasant but highly effective
      or
      ### The patient felt neutral effects ⚖️
      or ### The patient felt better - the treatment worked well.
      Or many others of your choice. 

    - **h5 markdown**: Use h5 markdown tags (#####) for headlines where the patient has suffered **serious harm** or a **fatal reaction**. When using h5:
      - If the patient **died**, always start with: ##### 💀 The patient has died! 💀
      - For more minor injuries, use something like:
        ##### The prescription seems to have failed... 
      - Be realistic about death and harm: some outcomes should reflect mild discomfort, but not all treatments should lead to nausea or purging unless the medicine calls for it.

    ### Patient Reactions:
    After the headline, describe the patient's experience over a period of three hours in 2 highly detailed paragraphs that emphasize vivid, historically authentic characterization and finely observed details:
    - Focus on the **sensory characteristics** of the medicine (e.g., taste, smell, texture). Always mention the route of administration and give specifics about how it was applied.
    - Show how the patient reacts to the prescribed dose, including the price. Reactions might range from a miraculous cure to mild discomfort, satisfaction, or a complete lack of effect. Purging, nausea, and more severe reactions should occur based on specific medicinal properties or improper dosage, but should not be the default response.
    - Describe the **perceived effects** of the medicine on the patient's health, and when appropriate, consider early modern concepts like humoral balance (hot, cold, wet, dry qualities). For example, if the patient suffers from a cold, damp ailment, the medicine may dry or heat them, bringing relief.
    - For toxic or fatal doses, be explicit about the timeline of worsening symptoms or death.

    ### Dosage & Effects:
    - One drachm of most medicines is usually safe, but two or more drachms of highly toxic substances (like quicksilver or laudanum) could lead to fatal outcomes. If the dose is fatal, show the NPC dying.
    - Benign things like wine, rose water, and other lightly infused or sugared medicines should not cause serious complications unless taken in excess or with aggravating factors.
    - Topical prescriptions (e.g., poultices or salves) are almost always well tolerated and effective for external ailments like wounds. For internal ailments, their effectiveness might be limited but not harmful.
    - Consider the patient's weight, health, and the route of administration in assessing whether a dose is fatal or highly toxic. Potent drugs like mercury, opium, or alchemical compounds should be dangerous in large doses, while other remedies are more likely to have mild effects.

    Following the description, include a historically authentic quote or proverb that reflects the situation. Rate the prescription with a score out of 10 (10=best possible prescription choice, 1=worst possible). At the end of the response, provide a summary of Maria's wealth, status, reputation, and the time (remember that at least four hours have passed) in **this exact format**:

    *Now Maria has ${currentWealth + price} silver coins. She is feeling [single word status]. Her reputation is [emoji]. The time is now # AM (or PM), xx [month] [year].*
    
    **Reputation Emoji Guide:**
    - 😡 (1) : Extremely bad (e.g., patient dies)
    - 😠 (2) : Very bad (e.g., severe complications)
    - 😐 (3) : Neutral (e.g., treatment is ineffective but not harmful)
    - 🙂 (5) : Positive (e.g., minor positive effects)
    - 😇 (9) : Excellent (e.g., miraculous cure)
    - 👑 (10) : Outstanding (e.g., near-mythical healing)
