        Pick another character in this world who may not be represented in historical narratives and who relates in some way to the action. Be creative about it (for instance, it could be the POV of a person who grew a given materia media mentioned in the turn on a different continent). Highlight their unique perspective, which might be absent from official records, and how they view the events happening around them. Limit to one paragraph. It should be from their particular POV and should be realistic - imagine a true to life, historically authentic situation that is plausible, i.e. it shouldn't be someone in the room who the other characters aren't aware of. Think SEA OF POPPIES by Amitav Ghosh. The POV here should NEVER be that of Maria de Lima, the Portuguese converso apothecary who is the main playable character of the game, but someone orthogonal to the narrative.  Do not use complex words or expressions. Keep it simple and honest.
